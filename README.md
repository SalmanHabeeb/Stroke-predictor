# Stroke-predictor

## Background
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death. In 2011, stroke was the 2nd leading cause of death, accounting for 6.2 million deaths worldwide(11% of total deaths). Some risk factors for stroke has been identified as hypertension, age, etc.. 

To develop further insights on the chances of a stroke, neural networks seem to me as the best bet. Deep learning models predict an event by attaching some probability to the event. This probability gives the chance of occurance of a stroke in our case. In this project we use deep learning model to predict chances of a person getting the stroke. The model is deployed on a Streamlit app for the same purpose.
