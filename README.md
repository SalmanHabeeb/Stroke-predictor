# Stroke-predictor

## Background
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death. In 2011, stroke was the 2nd leading cause of death, accounting for 6.2 million deaths worldwide(11% of total deaths). Major risk factors of stroke have been identified as hypertension, age, previous occurance of heart disease and others. Nevertheless, chances of occurance of a stroke are hard to determine even now. 

However, deep learning models offer a promising approach on computing these chances. To predict the occurance of an event, deep learning models compute the probability that the event will occur. This probability gives the chance of occurance of that event. In this project, I use deep learning model to predict chances of a person getting the stroke. The model is trained and tested on the dataset available in this repository. I have deployed the model on a Streamlit app, for people to make predictions.
